# Incorrect Conditional Rendering in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: incorrect conditional rendering logic.  The provided code contains a flaw in how it handles different states of the `count` variable, leading to a situation where one branch of the conditional statement is never executed.

The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The conditional statement within the `useEffect` hook is designed to log a message based on the value of `count`. However, because `count` is an integer variable, it will always satisfy either the `if` or the `else if` conditions, rendering the `else` condition unreachable.  This is a subtle logic error that can cause unexpected behavior if the `else` block contained important logic.

## Solution

The solution simplifies the conditional logic, removing the unnecessary and unreachable `else` statement.  This makes the code more concise and avoids potential future bugs.
